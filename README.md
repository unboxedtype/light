**Light**   is  a   next-generation  programming   language  targeting
TON-inspired blockchains, and specifically [EverScale](https://everscale.network/)
and [Venom](https://venom.network/). Light is
a   statically-typed  functional   reactive  actor-based   programming
language with  lots of features  coming for the  first time ever  in a
modern blockchain programming landscape.

Light  is a  part of the bigger _Lighthouse_  programming system  aiming to
significantly boost developers productivity and program safety,
_reducing time-to-market_ and _lowering project delivery risks_.
For details, have a look at our [Lighthouse Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v5oPb1T8g-Vd-OBStiSlsjDg3VuqJCJdq3loqoc8KoY/edit#).

# Language Features

We highlight the following features of the Light language:

* **Algebraic Data Types with Type Parameters**

  "Product" types for records,  and "sum"-types for variants, recursive
  type  definitions,   etc.  This  type  system   provides  means  for
  specifying rich message and storage data schemes.

  ```OCaml
  (* State type defines the content and shape of the actor state *)
  type State = {
    pubkey: PubKey ;
    deposits: map<ActorId, uint> ;
    requests: list<ActorId>
  }

  (* Sum (or Variant) type define several possible constructors
     for values; you may use only one of them *)
  type Token =
  | FungibleToken of n:uint
  | NonFungibleToken of id:ActorId

  (* Recursive data types *)
  type List<'T> =
  | Nil
  | Cons of (h : T) * (t : List<T>)

  (* Optional type *)
  type Option<'T> =
  | None
  | Some of (n:T)
  ```

* **Functions as First-Class Objects**

  The  really distinguishing  feature  of the  Light  language is  its
  ability  to  send,  receive,  store,  extend  and  shrink  arbitrary
  *functions*.   It is  for  the  first time  ever  you  can not  only
  transmit  data,  but also  attach  custom  *business logic*  to  it.
  Computation  can  now travel  between  systems  of actors  gradually
  converging into a result.

  ```OCaml
  (* Attach functions to messages as if it is an ordinary data. *)
  (* Later, the receiver will be able to execute the function   *)
  type Message =
    Message of (n:uint) * (func: uint -> uint)

  (* Recursive factorial function *)
  let rec fac n =
      if (n > 1) then n * fac (n - 1)
      else 1
  ;;

  let sum a b = a + b ;;        (* sum of two numbers, just for example *)
  let sum5 = sum 5 ;;           (* partial function application *)
  let sum105 = sum5 100 ;;      (* this equals 5 + 100 *)

  (* Tail-recursive sum of numbers list *)
  (* example: sum_list2 [1;2;3] 0  =  6   *)
  let rec sum_list2 lst acc =
     match lst with
     | [] -> acc
     | h :: t -> sum_list t (h + acc)
  ```

* **Message-oriented control flow**

  The language  provides several operators that  allow structuring the
  control flow around the message processing.
  - operator **receive**
  - operator **send (!)**

  Operator **receive** gives opportunity to express logic in a form of dialogues
  between smart-contracts.

  ```OCaml
  receive
  | Deposit (NonFungibleTokens n) ->
    if n < 100 then
      let sender = ctx.msg.src in
      sender ! DepositFeedback (SendExtraTokens (100 - n)) ;
      receive
      | Deposit (NonFungibleTokens p) when ctx.msg.src = sender  ->
         assert (n + p > 100) ;
         depositTokens ctx.msg.src (n + p)
      after 100 ->
         failwith #"extra deposit request failed"
  after 100 ->
    failwith #"amount is too small"
  end
  ```

  The **receive** operator "suspends" actor  execution until a new message
  arrives;  after  that, the  actor  does  the pattern-matching  on  the
  message content.  If the corresponding  pattern is found, the  body of
  the corresponding pattern handler  is executed. Unmatched messages may
  be skipped or bounced back. The "after" value specifies the message
  receiving deadline, i.e. for how long we wait for the message before giving up
  and continuing the execution. The operator "receive" can be nested.

* **Optional Mutability**

  Functional   programming  encourages   programming  with   immutable
  variables, but  when you  need mutability, you  still have  it, with
  familiar cycles, exceptions etc.

  ```OCaml
  try
    let mutable cond = false in
    let mutable n = 0 in
    while not cond do
      n <- n + 1 ;
      if (n > 100) then
         cond <- true ;
      if (n > 1000) then
         raise (Overflow n) ;
    done
  with
  | Overflow k ->
      // specific exception handler goes here
  | e ->
      // general exception handler goes here
  ```

* **Actors as First-class Objects**

   The language provides means to spawn ('create') other actors on the
   fly,  with convenient  programming constructs.  The actor  logic is
   passed either as module definition or as a function.

   ```OCaml
   type ActorMessage =
   | Say of (s:string)
   | Quit

   (* This is a body of another actor *)
   let rec actorFun () =
     receive
     | Say of s ->
        print s ;
        (* recursive call to itself after message received *)
        actorFun ()
     | Quit -> ()

   (* create new actor with empty state *)
   let actId = spawn actFun () in
   actId  ! Say "hi!" ;         (* Send some messages *)
   actId  ! Say "hello!" ;
   actId  ! Quit

   ```

   Spawning actors "in-place" is also possible:
   ```OCaml
   spawn ( fun () -> ctx.sender ! ("hi!") ) ;
   ```


* **Static Typing with Automatic Inference**

  If the program compiles, it is considered safe (runtime exception safety)
  most of the time. Strong static type system safe programmers from subtle bugs.
  However, specifying types may be daunting task. This is why Light provide
  automatic type inference.

  Types are automatically  inferred from the context.  The type safety
  is guaranteed by the compiler.

```OCaml
  let print_string s =
     print s

  (* this is also correct *)
  let print_string (s:string) =
     print s
```

* **Delayed (Lazy) Execution**

  Some pieces  of logic should be  executed only when and  if they are
  needed,  not when  they are  defined.  This  lets you  define things
  without worrying too much about sub-optimal gas usage. This, in turn,
  removes the temptation  of doing premature optimization  that is, as
  we all know, the root of all evil.

  Lazy computation construct allows exactly this, in a type-safe way.

  ```OCaml
  (* We do not know how many sequence numbers we will
     need in the future. This is why we generate infinite
     stream of them, taking one at a time when we need them. *)
  let nextNumber () : Lazy<uint> =
    let mutable n:uint = 0 in
    while true do
      n <- n + 1 ;
      yield n
    done
  in
    let x = force (nextNumber ()) in   (* x = 1 *)
    let y = force (nextNumber ()) in   (* y = 2 *)
    x + y   (* =3 *)
  ```

# Prototype restrictions

The vision stated  in the Overview section  implemented only partially
at  the moment.   Currently,  we  implemented:

 * Compiler for Light  Core  - the  core language that lets us build all
   the described constructs atop of it.
 * Deploy scripts that let you prepare .BOC files to deploy actors
   in the blockchain
 * Message scripts that let you prepare .BOC with messages
 * Prepared samples in [samples](https://github.com/unboxedtype/light/tree/main/samples) folder.

# Manual

Here we provide step-by-step guide how to make the compiler prototype work for you.

Light compiler rely on STCONT/LDCONT instructions. Both instructions present in Venom/EverScale VM,
however, its availability for smart-contracts is regulated by the network capability CapStContNewFormat.

Currently, Venom Dev-net has this cap turned off, so there are two options left:
1. Run actors locally using ```tvm_linker test``` (not that fun, but still a viable option)
2. Run actors in FLD network: the FLD network administrator kindly enabled this capability specifically
   for Light programmers.


## Installation

**1.** Build and install the following:

   * `tvm_linker` from [here](https://github.com/unboxedtype/TVM-linker) (**NOTE**: it is our custom `tvm_linker`, not the one supplied by EverX!)

   * `fift` from [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton)

   * `tonos-cli` from [here](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli)

   After installation, ensure that all commands are visible inside your `$PATH`.

**2.** Install Microsoft .NET framework.

   See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) for instruction on how to do that for your Linux distro.

   Ensure that ```dotnet fsi``` command is working.

**3.** Build the Light compiler.

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/unboxedtype/light
   $ cd light
   $ make build
   ```

**4.** Put the directory `<light>/scripts/` into the `PATH`

   ```shell
   $ export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/scripts/
   ```

   Check that the command `genActorMessage.fsx` and `serializeExpression.fsx` are visible.

**5.** Make the LHCompiler binary visible. For that, do one of the following:

   * Put the directory `<light>/src/LHCompiler/bin/net6.0/` into the `PATH`
     ```shell
     $ export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/src/LHCompiler/bin/net6.0/
     ```

   * OR Make a symbolic link to `LHCompiler` binary:

     ```shell
     $ sudo ln -s $(pwd)/src/LHCompiler/bin/Debug/net6.0/LHCompiler /usr/bin/LHCompiler
     ```

   Ensure that the command `LHCompiler` works afterwards.

**6.** Go to `<light>/samples/Sample<N>` directory. There you will find `test.sh` script. Run it and do what it asks for. Inside the scripts, you can find all the necessary commands to deploy and interact with Light actors!
